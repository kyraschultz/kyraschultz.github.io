I am currently a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computer Science. I absolutely LOVE cats and would do anything for my cat Moe <3. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my friends, playing board games, and spending time outside (when it's warm out).

I'm interested in using what I learn from computer science and being able to apply it to different causes such as helping the environment or giving back to the community! Recently, I have been involved in Pitt's Habitat for Humanity club where we help renovate and build homes for limited income families. This semester I plan to join a club where I can be more involved with the environment!
